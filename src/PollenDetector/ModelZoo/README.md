This repository includes ready-to-use deep learning models to detect multiple pollen taxons.\
The following table includes comprehensive information about each model, including input size, number of classes and evaluation mAP metric.\
A Pollen detector inference test implemented with TensorFlow 2 is also available in this repo.
