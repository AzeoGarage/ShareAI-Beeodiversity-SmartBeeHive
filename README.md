# ShareAI-BeeOdiversity-SmartBeeHive
In the context of [Microsoft's ShareAI initiative](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lintelligence-artificielle-au-service-du-bien-commun-eneric-lopez/), AZEO has decided to help the social entrepreneur BeeOdiversity with its Data and AI skills. 
[BeeOdiversity](https://beeodiversity.com/fr/) uses bees as natural drones to identify the biodiversity of an area around hives by analysing the gathered pollen.

Today, the pollen collected by the BeeOdiversity trap is analysed in a laboratory, at best once a week. 
The objective is to carry out part of the analysis in "real time", directly in the hive, identifying the pollen using Computer Vision techniques. 
The aim is to reduce the cost and latency of the analysis and thus considerably increase the collected biodiversity data. 
The project is divided into 2 parts:  
1. **Optical engineering:** To be able to get a "usable" image of the pollens by microscopy (x100) with the hive's conditions (luminosity, etc.). 
2. **Machine Learning:** Analyse an image and recognise the pollens, by using classification or object detection. 

## Defining jobs :
IoT hatch 
Studying microscopy solutions 
Development of a prototype trap door (pollen collection and shooting) 
Integration as an IoT device (design, BoM, configuration, etc.) 
Integration in a real hive 
Pollen detection model 
Working with universities / researchers to build up the pollen knowledge base (dataset) 
Choice between classification or detection 
Training and interpretability 
Industrialization (MLOps) 
Edge Optimisation 
IoT hatch integration 

The technologies used to carry out this project are mainly the services of the Azure platform and Linux devices. Among others we can find (non exhaustive list) : 
Azure Machine Learning 
Azure IoT stack 
Programming languages: Python, Spark, .NET Core (C#) 
Linux, Raspberry Pi 

## Open Innovation 
Important : The project is in [Open Innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation) as an AZEO, BeeODiversity and Microsoft initiative.  
The objective is to share and collaborate with people working in the palynology (pollen study), allergology, biodiversity and beekeeping fileds. Everyone will be able to contribute data, knowledge, know-how, etc. and will be able to benefit from the project results. 
The linked principles to this open innovation which have been selected for the project : 
Open and public pollen recognition model training data set 
Public and open source pollen recognition model 
Shared biodiversity data (access only to stakeholders)
